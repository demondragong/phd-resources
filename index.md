Do you need some help with your PhD? Here is a collection of cool resources, websites and software to get you started. Some of them are in French or specific to students in France, but the majority can be useful to anyone, including students at many different levels, early-career researchers or scientists in other institutions.

This is meant to be a collaborative endeavor, so if you have things to add, you're more than welcome to contribute by <a href="mailto:guillaume.dalle@enpc.fr?subject=contributing to PhD Resources">sending me an email</a>.
