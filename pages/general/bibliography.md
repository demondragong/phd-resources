### The restricted section

The following websites contain millions of full-text articles and books, gathered with sometimes dubious methods. Due to regular conflicts with law enforcement, they often change their URL, which is why I link to their Wikipedia page instead. Of course, I cannot officially recommend them, but if you want to use them, it's not like I can stop you!
