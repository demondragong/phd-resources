As a PhD student, especially in STEM, you are likely to need several programming languages to get the job done. For instance, I regularly need to open Markdown, LaTeX, Python, Julia, JSON and PDF files. Of course, you could switch between software to open or edit each kind of file, but it becomes tiresome after a while.

This is why I recommend using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is a fully customizable environment that allows you to edit and run code in basically every language. The one I use is [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is free but provided by Microsoft. Note that an open source version exists, it is called [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/).

## Setting up VSCode

First, go to the [download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and select the version corresponding to your OS. When you launch it for the first time, be sure to synchronize your settings with your GitHub account, so you can recreate the same environment on multiple computers.

### Extensions

The success of VSCode is partly due to a great catalogue of extensions. For every programming language, there usually is one VSCode extension that does everything you need. Here is a list of the ones I use.

| Language | Useful extensions                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Using VSCode

Although such a powerful IDE can be intimidating at first, there are only a few things to remember:

- The left column contains shortcuts for the most important functionalities (file explorer, search, Git, extensions) as well as the settings and the user profile.
- The top bar contains the menu, while the bottom bar contains a lot of clickable information provided by various extensions.
- The most important keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac), which allows you to type in what you want to do and find a command that does it.
