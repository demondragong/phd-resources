Once you reach a certain number of articles and books, simply storing them as PDF files is no longer enough. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a bibliography manager that lets you easily organize and exploit your academic sources.

## Setting up Zotero

To get started quickly, take a look at [this guide](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide) explaining the main features of the software. A more extensive documentation is available [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/).

### Installation

Zotero has two main building blocks, which can both be installed from the [downloads page](https://www.zotero.org/download/):

- The standalone app, which is responsible for storing and handling your references
- The browser connector, which allows you to directly download papers into the app from a journal's webpage

### Synchronization

If you use Zotero from multiple computers, or even if you just want an online backup of your collections, you may want to use the built-in [synchronization features](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync). My advice is to store the article metadata using the Zotero server, but to sync full-text files using a dedicated WebDAV-compatible cloud service from [this list](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/webdav_services).

### Plugins

Zotero comes with a variery of community-developed [plugins](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins) which can make your workflow easier. The most useful ones in my opinion are:

- [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/) for managing attachments and extracting notes from PDF
- [Zotero DOI Manager](https://github.com/bwiernik/zotero-shortdoi) to handle missing DOIs
- [Word Processor Plugins](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration) to use Zotero from Word, LibreOffice or Google Docs
- [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) to use Zotero from LaTeX or Markdown
