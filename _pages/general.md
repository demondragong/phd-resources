In this category you will find general tips and tricks that can be useful to PhD students from all walks of life.

Here are a few useful links for PhD students in France: 
- [FAQ CJC](https://cjc.jeunes-chercheurs.org/faq/): The FAQ section of an association for young researchers
- [Le Guide du Doctorat](https://guide-doctorat.fr/): A very extensive guide to doctoral studies

In addition, I can only recommend this very welcoming online community:
- [PhD Students Discord](https://discord.gg/QNRWg6zYQE): Over a thousand grad students from a lot of different fields and backgrounds. Come and join us to ask questions, seek support or simply work together.
