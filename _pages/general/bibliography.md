## Finding papers

- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) : Your first stop for a quick search
- [ConnectedPapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/): Find related papers and explore their connections
- [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/) : Literature survey assistant
- [VosViewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/) : Visualize bibliometric networks

> Please note that I do not recommend to go look for papers and books on [SciHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub), [LibGen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis) or [Z-Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Library). You run the risk of finding exactly what you are looking for.
